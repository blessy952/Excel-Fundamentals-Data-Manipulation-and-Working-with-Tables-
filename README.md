# Excel-Fundamentals-Data-Manipulation-and-Working-with-Tables-
Excel project for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing business sales and performance data.

## Situation:
I was presented with raw and unstructured datasets containing business sales and performance data. The datasets lacked consistency, had missing values, and were not formatted for analysis or reporting. Stakeholders needed a clear, organized view of the data to support operational and strategic decisions.

## Task:
My objective was to clean, organize, and analyze the data using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to produce structured, interactive reports and dashboards that would make trends and KPIs easy to interpret, enabling faster and more informed decision-making by business teams.

## Action:
- Data Cleaning & Preparation:
    - Removed duplicates, standardized date and text fields, and filled in missing values using logical assumptions or Excel functions (e.g., IF, ISBLANK, TEXT, VLOOKUP)
    - Formatted raw data into structured tables for easy referencing and consistency
- Data Analysis:
    - Created PivotTables to summarize key metrics such as total sales, units sold, and average revenue by product category, region, and time period
    - Used sorting and filtering to identify top-performing products and low-performing areas
- Visualization & Reporting:
  - Applied conditional formatting to highlight top/bottom performers, outliers, and thresholds (e.g., sales < target)
  - Built dynamic charts (line, bar, pie, combo) to visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and category comparisons
  - Designed an interactive Excel dashboard combining charts, tables, and slicers for end-user exploration

## Result:
- Delivered a structured and visually engaging Excel report that improved data accessibility and analytical clarity
- Enabled business stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly by surfacing key trends, opportunities, and issues
  Increased reporting efficiency by automating key calculations and visualizations
  Strengthened my practical expertise in Excel for real-world data analysis, including dashboarding, logic-based automation, and storytelling with data
